# CoreAnimationPractice
This repo follows Project 15: Core Animation at hackingwithswift.com.

## Concepts Learned/Practiced
* Switch statements
* Core Animation
  * ```CGAffineTransform``` struct
    * ```CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation()```
    * ```CGAffineTransformIdentity```
    * ```CGAffineTransformMakeRotation```
    * ```CGAffineTransformMakeScale```
* More use of trailing closures, this time the closure is a switch statement and also another closure once the switch statement has executed to unhide the tap button
